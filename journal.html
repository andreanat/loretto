                    <h2>Dior seeking €100,000.00 in compensation from Valentino</h2>
                    <p> Also near the Steps is one of Diors nearly 200 boutiques, and now the brand is claiming Valentino’s presence impeded their customers access to the store. WWD reports they sent a letter to Valentino demanding compensation to the tune of €100,000, payable in two weeks before they take legal action.
                    
                        Dior isnt the only brand with a presence near the Steps, they have neighbors ranging from Camper shoes to Chanel, but they are seemingly the first to complain. Valentino reportedly sent out a letter ahead of the show letting retailers know of the event, and promising their foot traffic would not be reduced, but Dior claimed their customers were blocked and redirected by security during last Friday afternoons show.

                    <h2>Marilyns 'Happy Birthday' dress was not damaged.</h2>
                    <p>'Ripleys- Believe it or not!-" has issued a rather inconclusive statement about the condition of Marilyn’s dress. In the 2 months since the iconic garment turned heads at the Met Gala, much of the outrage over its appearance has shifted from Kim, to Ripley’s and their decision to loan it for wear. Now, they’re claiming no damage was done.
                
                        “Kim Kardashian wearing the dress has been hotly contested, but she did not personally damage the garment in the short amount of time it was worn at the Met Gala,” the only museum known to rent significant cultural artifacts said in the statement. They also cited a 2017 condition report on the dress that stated “a number of the seams are pulled and worn. This is not surprising given how delicate the material is.”

                    <h2>H&M VS ChetLo</h2>
                    <p>The London-based Asian-American knitwear designer launched his eponymous brand in 2020 during the pandemic after graduating from Central Saint Martins. Best known for his futuristic, highly textured knitwear, Lo’s career has been on a steady upward trajectory, landing some major celebrity placements like Doja Cat and SZA sporting matching spiky knit tops in the uber popular “Kiss Me More” music video, racking up 329 million YouTube views. Lo also counts Kylie Jenner, Willow Smith, and Dua Lipa amongst his fans, and the brand is gaining international distribution with stockists like Selfridges and SSENSE.
                        H&M’s “Innovation Cherish Waste” line claims to be “designed with circularity in mind” and uses “conscious” materials, but the very specific and trendy nature of the pieces themselves make it hard to imagine them having the intended longevity—did somebody say greenwashing?
